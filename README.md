# todotxt-gtksourceview

![gedit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Circumjacence/todotxt-gtksourceview/master/screenshot.png)

Language definition for the [GtkSourceView v3/v4/v5](https://https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/) GTK+ multiline text editing library.  This brings context-sensitive highlighting to [GEdit](https://apps.gnome.org/app/org.gnome.TextEditor/), [GMate](https://github.com/gmate/gmate), etc. for the [todo.txt format](http://todotxt.org/).


## Usage

Copy `todotxt.lang` into one of these directories: 

- GtkSourceView 3:
  - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
- GtkSourceView 4:
  - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/`
- GtkSourceView 5:
  - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-5/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-5/language-specs/`

_gedit_ and other tools using GtkSourceView should then show todo.txt syntax highlighting.
