# todotxt-gtksourceview

GtkSourceView syntax highlighting for the [todo.txt format](http://todotxt.org/).

This is my first foray into GtkSourceView definitions, so it likely needs more work.


## Usage

Copy `todotxt.lang` into one of these directories: 

- GtkSourceView 3:
  - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
- GtkSourceView 4:
  - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/`
  - `/usr/local/share/gtksourceview-4/language-specs/`

_gedit_ and other tools using GtkSourceView should then show todo.txt syntax highlighting.
