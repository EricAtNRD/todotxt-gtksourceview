====================
![gedit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Circumjacence/todotxt-gtksourceview/master/screenshot.png)

GtkSourceView syntax highlighting for the [todo.txt format](http://todotxt.org/).

This is my first foray into GtkSourceView definitions, so it likely needs more work...

## Usage: 

Copy `todotxt.lang` into one of these directories: 

 * `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`
 * `/usr/local/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`
 * `/usr/share/gtksourceview-X.X/language-specs/`

Replace 'X.X' with your version of GtkSourceView.

_gedit_ and other tools using GtkSourceView should then show Elixir syntax highlighting.
